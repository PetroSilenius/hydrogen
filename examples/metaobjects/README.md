# Hydrogen example: Metaobjects Content

This folder contains an example implementation of using [metaobjects](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metaobjects)
as a thin Content Management System (CMS) for Hydrogen.

More specifically, this example focuses on how to render and manage custom content
at a route and section level.

## Requirements


- Basic understanding of metaobjects. Creating metaobject [definitions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metaobjects/building-a-metaobject),
creating metaobject [entries](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metaobjects/creating-entries).
For more info, please refer to this [tutorial](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metaobjects/using-metaobjects)
- Must use the "mock.shop" store because it has the required definitions and entries
to make this example work. To use this example in your own store please read the
[Implementing it in your store](#Implementing in your store) section below.


## Key files

This folder contains the minimal set of files needed to showcase the implementation.
Files that arenâ€™t included by default with Hydrogen and that youâ€™ll need to
create are labeled with ðŸ†•.

## Dependencies

## Instructions

### 1. Link the mock.shop store to inject the required environment variables

Create or adjust the environment file `.env` at the root of the project

```
SESSION_SECRET="foobar"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="mock.shop"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to use your store instead please ensure that the [required metaobjects](TODO)
structure has been created.

### 2. Copy over the ðŸ†• files

- utils/
- sections/
- components/
- routes/

### 3. Modify the homepage route

Import the `RouteContent` component and query

```ts
import {ROUTE_CONTENT_QUERY, RouteContent} from '~/sections/RouteContent';
```

Adjust the loader to query for the route metaobject content

```
export async function loader({context}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const {storefront} = context;

  const {route} = await storefront.query(ROUTE_CONTENT_QUERY, {
    variables: {handle: 'route-home'},
    cache: storefront.CacheNone(),
  });

  return json({route});
}
```

Render the route's content sections with RouteContent

```
export default function Homepage() {
  const {route} = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();

  return (
    <div className="home">
      <RouteContent route={route} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can repeat this same process in any other route that should be capable of rendering
route content entries.

[View the complete component file](app/routes/_index.tsx) to see these updates in context.

### (Optional) Initialize a new project based on this example

```bash
h2 init --template metaobjects
```

Create an environment file `.env` at the root of the project

```
SESSION_SECRET="foobar"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="mock.shop"
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
```
